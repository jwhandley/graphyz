# Graphyz

A simple program for real-time force directed graph layout simulation. Loosely based on the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm, d3-force, and force atlas 2.
Work in progress.

- Force atlas 2: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098679

## To-do
- Implement an optimization such as the Barnes-Hut algorithm for the many body forces (needed for scaling beyond a few hundred nodes)
- Allow users to use their own graph data
- Add support for additional formats
